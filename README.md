CWAPP: A Visualization Tool for Material Science (CrystalWalk)


CrystalWalk is a crystal editor and visualizer software designed for teaching materials science and engineering. Based in WebGL/HTML5, it provides an accessible and interactive platform to students, professors and researchers.


CrystalWalk is an open-source project developed by Fernando Bardella’s Nuclear Technology PhD research at the Nuclear Energy Research Institute (IPEN) / Brazilian National Nuclear Commission (CNEN) at University of São Paulo (USP).


A series of tutorials on how to create and explore crystal structures is accessible at CrystalWalk’s Instructable Channel at http://www.instructables.com/id/CrystalWalk-Collection/, including a step-by-step application deployment procedures at http://www.instructables.com/id/Deploy-CWAPP/ . Also, a series of technical documentation of the current and ongoing development of the project is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxQKRQ7aLz7r4Hrv3zu0Aua-lRrKZr8if2zkUVXuAxo/edit?usp=sharing, https://docs.google.com/document/d/16VKy25UltiUoBvgJoyX0JpteNCaTv5u0YEVL1QhlDsk/edit?usp=sharing and https://docs.google.com/document/d/15cTc8CgPLOmk-rd-ghffl-NcSTRF7zKQndVsURpc2Nk/edit?usp=sharing.
