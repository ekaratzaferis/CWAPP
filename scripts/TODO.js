    1.  xyz labels not moving when zoom in/out  
    2.  hold all data of an atom to be updatable  
    3.  grid has duplicates 

    5.  hex grid (at least) in hex does not update (radius,color) when parameter changes 

    6.  hex faces optimization
    7.  hex grid and faces are not deleted when other lattice is selected 

    8.  change the reference in lattice hex to simpler _x+_y+_z+_r
    9.  change the recreate of hex and use transform function as others
    10. recreate motif fro hexagonal also needs optimization 
    11. adjust hud arrows, cube according to width length (add a constant value + adjustable par)
    12. between changing view mode it must go to classic first (except for gradeLimited)  
    13. sync cams and enable distortion do not work together
    14. distortion doesnt work perfect
    
    
    16. miller objects recreate function can be optimized
    17. delete the restore function object after scene has restored to prevent memory usage 
    18. sync cameras when autoratating do not work great 
    19. check every global array for memory leaks
    20. available atoms list for rotating in drag mode shouldnt have the NewSphere atom in. 
    21. hexagonal is not restored well
    22. opacity is not restored well and does not work after the first atom 
    23. collision with more than 2 atoms (to handle dragging atom inside atom by the user)  
    24. stereoscopic function doesnt work when I first go to motif editor and then enable it  
    25. when change view, if you change tab and return in MT bug    
    26. Ligths full deactivation fro performance
    27. Calculate better the center of crystal
    28. Grade Limited View and subtracted view for hexagonal Strange
    29. Disable everything when we are viewing the cell or crystal in subtracted and solid void.
    30. When go bak to classic view from subtracted in cell, distances appear.
    31. Add loader which freezes mouse events 
    32. When applying new motif to crystal auto position camera far from crystal.
 
 

VISUALIZATION TODOs

    2- View modes
    10- Stereoscopic Effect
    4- panoramic or ortogonal view (it s called  enable distortion  today)
    RENDERIZATION
    1- Texture
    14- *Wireframe
    9- Atom radius
    EVIRONMENT OPTIONS
    14- Fog on/off - color and density
    3- x, y, z and a, b, c axes (the same we have on the toggle bar)
    7- lights on/off
    12- Sounds on/off
    5- Full screen option
    TOOLS
    6- text notes (button and tranparent box)
    SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION
    8- background s color change (all of them)
    EXTERNAL GADGETS
    13- Leap Motion
    11- Rift Oculus


TODO 2

    1- change the URL project save/share to be cw.gl/### 
    2- On the Motif Editor( ME), update the lenght and angles sliders in real time
    3- On the ME - If the user clicks on fixed length, don t change it to be (1,1,1), let it on hte actual length
    4-  on the Miller directions, add a line radius editor
    5- Add a option to change the background color
    6- Gearbox (tour)
    7- 3D sound (sonar) on the crystal centar
    8- Crystal doll
    9- add the length values on the a, b and c axis
    10- add fog
    11- make a change on the unit cell visualization (to consider the neighbourhood atoms) - I ll explain when you choose to do this
    12- add a lattice padlock
    13- leap motion and rift oculus


List with Ideas

    1. Syncing with user dropbox to store a project there and reopen it later
    2. Public library of CW Projects - search by keywords, most popular etc
    3. Miller object use sliders for indexes
    4. all screens resizable 
    5. parameters for lighting (maybe this is too much)
       
    8- Crystal doll  
    11- make a change on the unit cell visualization (to consider the neighbourhood atoms) 
    13- leap motion and rift oculus
 

 New TODO

 1. Fix Menu Position when Full Screen ( do this after new UI menu is applied)
