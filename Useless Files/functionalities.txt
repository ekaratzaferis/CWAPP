6. Status bar (see command bar in AutoCad)
 6.1 It will show propeties of what is selected or mouser over, such as atomic radious, element name, actual distances (for the grade) and other properties

7. Text box
7.1 text box for annotations

8. The user must be able to take a photo of the actual screen and save it as jpg

9. Every distance will be given in angstroms

10. Visualization features
 10.1 Crop (Unity cell. See WBS)
 10.2 Motif
 10.3 Simplified unity cell
 10.4 Empty space

11. Hexagonal structure:
- 11.1 Grade
- 11.2 Angles and distancs editor
- 11.3 Miller indexes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK913oWl_XI


12. Lattice and Atoms replication
 12.1 lattice points and atoms independency
 12.2 lattice x, y, z replication
 12.3 atoms replication (respecting the motif)

Keep in mind (second and third phases):

A. It will be possible to select an epsecific atom and:
 A.1 Hide
 A.2 Exclude

B. The interface will be defined in the second phase, and the main reference is the AutoCad: http://download.autodesk.com/us/autocad/learningpath/interface_overview/scap_acad_numbered.png

C: We will build libraries of atoms and basics crystaline structures in the second phase. The user will be able to select such libraries

D: The user will be able to save the actual crystal (snap shot) to load it later. We will save the parameters in a data base and we will provide him/her a link to load the state later

E: Restrictions: the atom radious is fixed, so there will be overlap in the first phase. We need to avoid it in the second phase
